# xdperf

🚧WIP🚧

xdperf is a high-performance network traffic generation tool that leverages XDP (eXpress Data Path). It can operate in both client and server modes, enabling measurement of network throughput and packet rate.

In addition, xdperf provides a flexible mechanism for transmitting arbitrary packets. This functionality is implemented through a plugin system based on WASM, which eliminates the dependency issues often encountered with Python-based tools like Trex. Another major advantage is that it does not rely on DPDK.

Furthermore, since xdperf is implemented in Go, it runs as a single binary, making deployment simple and convenient.

## Install
